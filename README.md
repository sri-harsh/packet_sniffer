# Packet Sniffer
While diagnosing the underlying problems of a network, we may want an essential tool that aids in monitoring network traffic and troubleshooting a network. Packet sniffer is one such tool.
Our project focuses on capturing and analyzing packets of data that flow through a particular network.
 Packet sniffer can be hardware device or software application. Our development tool is a software application. This tool runs on standard general-purpose computers performing packet sniffing tasks by using the hardware capabilities of the network.
This tool allows the user to be able to view Source of the packets and display the target host and the type of protocol used like UDP OR TCP.
Various transport layer protocols like TCP, UDP, are implemented for analysis.
packet sniffers are used to troubleshoot and rectify network-related problems.
